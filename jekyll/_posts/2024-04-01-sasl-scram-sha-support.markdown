title: "SASL SCRAM-SHA support now in Irssi"
---

The development version of Irssi now has support for the SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-512 challenge-response SASL authentication. You can use this mechanism on libera.chat, alphachat.net, contempt.chat and maybe others. It is a mechanism where the server knows your password but you do not send the password itself to the server.

Thanks to **Patrick Okraku** for the contribution.
